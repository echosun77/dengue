# Cell type-specific immunological hallmarks in dengue children

 We profiled the viral and host transcriptomes in PBMCs derived from 19 DENV-infected children and 4 healthy controls using an optimized viscRNA-Seq 2 approach. 

 We computed the abundance, gene expression and communication network of multiple distinct cell types across disease categories and validated key observations by single-cell proteomics and functional assays in patient-derived samples. 

 Our findings reveal DENV target cells in the human blood and point to key molecular mechanisms preceding SD progression.
