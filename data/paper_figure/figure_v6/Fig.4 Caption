Fig.4 Cell cell communication analysis between different cell types in children.

A) Illustration showing how to get panel B 

B)Heatmap showing the number of interactions between different cell types for dengue, and severe dengue kids. Each square (eg. B cells vs B cells) has two parts, representing three conditions, ie. up: severe dengue, bottom: dengue. Color of each part means normalized number of interactions between cell types, which is calculated by (number of interaction - minimum number of interactions)/maximum number of interactions. 

C) Illustration showing how to get panel D, G, J

D) Heatmap showing the number of upregulated interactions between different cell types in severe dengue compared with dengue
E) Dotplot showing the average expression and expression fraction of some upregulated interactions
F) Violin plot of specific interaction: CTLA4-CD86


G) Heatmap showing the number of downregulated interactions between different cell types in severe dengue compared with dengue
H) Dotplot showing the average expression and expression fraction of some dwonregulated interactions
I) Violin plot of specific interaction: FASLG-FAS

J) Heatmap showing the number of interactions with a upregulated gene and a downregulated gene between different cell types in severe dengue compared with dengue
K) Dotplot showing the average expression and expression fraction of some interactions
L) Violin plot of specific interaction: CXCR3-CXCL10, CCR2-CCL2

M) some orphan interactions or interactions with one gene doesn't express
